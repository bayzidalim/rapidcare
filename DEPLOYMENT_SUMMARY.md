2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Set root directory to `front-end`
4. Add environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<your-railway-url>/api`
5. Deploy automatically

## 🔧 Environment Variables Setup

### Backend (Railway/Render)
```env
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-change-this
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
```

### Frontend (Vercel)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api
```
