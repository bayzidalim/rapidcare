# Notification Service Implementation Summary

## Task 8: Create notification service for patient updates

### âœ… Completed Components

#### 1. NotificationService (`back-end/services/notificationService.js`)
- **Booking Status Notifications**: Complete implementation for approval, decline, completion, and cancellation notifications
- **Email/SMS Templates**: Dynamic template generation with resource-specific content
- **Queue System**: Robust notification queuing with priority support and retry logic
- **Delivery Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of notification delivery attempts and results
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Automatic hospital suggestions for declined bookings

#### 2. Database Schema (`back-end/migrations/003_notification_system.js`)
- **notification_queue**: Main queue table with status tracking, retry logic, and scheduling
- **notification_delivery_log**: Delivery tracking and audit trail
- **Indexes**: Performance optimized with proper indexing for common queries

#### 3. Integration with Booking Approval Service
- **Automatic Notifications**: Integrated with `BookingApprovalService` to send notifications on:
  - Booking approvals with next steps and hospital contact info
  - Booking declines with reasons and alternative hospital suggestions
  - Booking completions with follow-up instructions
  - Booking cancellations with refund information

#### 4. API Endpoints (`back-end/routes/notifications.js`)
- **POST /api/notifications/process-queue**: Admin endpoint to manually trigger queue processing
- **GET /api/notifications/statistics**: Admin analytics for notification performance
- **GET /api/notifications/history**: User notification history with filtering
- **POST /api/notifications/test**: Admin endpoint for testing notification delivery

#### 5. Background Processing (`back-end/utils/notificationProcessor.js`)
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch size and processing intervals
- **Continuous Mode**: Background daemon for automatic queue processing
- **Statistics**: Queue monitoring and performance metrics
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old delivered notifications
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for queue management

#### 6. Comprehensive Testing (`back-end/tests/services/notificationService.test.js`)
- **29 Test Cases**: Complete test coverage including:
  - All notification types (approval, decline, completion, cancellation)
  - Queue processing and delivery mechanisms
  - Template generation for email and SMS
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Statistics and history functionality
  - Helper methods and utility functions

### ðŸ”§ Key Features

#### Template System
- **Dynamic Content**: Resource-specific next steps and follow-up instructions
- **Personalization**: Patient names, hospital details, and booking information
- **Multi-Channel**: Separate templates for email (detailed) and SMS (concise)
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful handling of missing data with sensible defaults

#### Queue Management
- **Priority System**: High, medium, low, and urgent priority levels
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable retry limits
- **Scheduling**: Support for immediate and scheduled delivery
- **Status Tracking**: Comprehensive status management (queued, processing, delivered, failed)

#### Delivery Channels
- **Email**: Rich HTML templates with detailed information
- **SMS**: Concise text messages with essential information
- **Extensible**: Architecture supports adding push notifications and other channels

#### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing even if individual notifications fail
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking and debugging information
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Monitoring**: Statistics and alerts for failed deliveries

### ðŸ“Š Performance Considerations
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes to prevent system overload
- **Database Indexes**: Optimized queries for queue processing and statistics
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming processing without loading entire queue into memory
- **Scalable**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling with multiple processors

### ðŸ”’ Security Features
- **Authentication**: All admin endpoints require proper authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all notification activities

### ðŸš€ Usage Examples

#### Manual Queue Processing
```bash
# Process 10 notifications once
node utils/notificationProcessor.js process 10

# Run continuously with high priority only
node utils/notificationProcessor.js process --continuous --priority=high

# View queue statistics
node utils/notificationProcessor.js stats

# Clean up old notifications
node utils/notificationProcessor.js cleanup 30
```

#### API Usage
```javascript
// Send approval notification
const result = await NotificationService.sendBookingApprovalNotification(
  bookingId, 
  patientId, 
  { hospitalName, resourceType, scheduledDate, notes }
);

// Process queue programmatically
const processed = await NotificationService.processNotificationQueue({ limit: 50 });
```

### âœ… Requirements Fulfilled

- **5.1**: âœ… Immediate notifications for booking approvals with confirmation details
- **5.2**: âœ… Decline notifications with reasons and alternative suggestions  
- **5.3**: âœ… Approval notifications include hospital contact and next steps
- **5.4**: âœ… Decline notifications suggest alternatives and support contact
- **5.5**: âœ… Automatic cancellation notifications with restoration of booking ability

### ðŸ§ª Test Results
All 29 test cases pass successfully, covering:
- Notification queuing and delivery
- Template generation and content validation
- Queue processing with different priorities
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Statistics and history functionality
- Integration with booking approval workflow

The notification service is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, monitoring, and scalability features.
